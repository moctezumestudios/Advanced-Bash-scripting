G.2. Bash Command-Line Options

Bash itself has a number of command-line options. Here are some of the more useful ones.

-c

Read commands from the following string and assign any arguments to the positional parameters.

bash$ bash -c 'set a b c d; IFS="+-;"; echo "$*"'
a+b+c+d
	      
-r

--restricted

Runs the shell, or a script, in restricted mode.

--posix

Forces Bash to conform to POSIX mode.

--version

Display Bash version information and exit.

--

End of options. Anything further on the command line is an argument, not an option.
